# Project Steps and Changes Log

## Project Initialization - August 30, 2025

### Initial Setup Completed
âœ… **Kiro Project Structure Created**
- Established complete `.kiro/` directory structure
- Created foundational steering files for persistent knowledge
- Defined core features and implementation phases

### Steering Files Created
âœ… **Core Steering Files**
- `product.md` - Product vision, goals, and business objectives
- `tech.md` - Complete technology stack and framework choices
- `structure.md` - Project organization and coding conventions
- `api-standards.md` - RESTful API design patterns and standards
- `security-policies.md` - HIPAA compliance and security requirements
- `testing-standards.md` - Testing strategies and quality assurance
- `healthcare-compliance.md` - Healthcare regulations and compliance
- `integration-patterns.md` - Healthcare system integration approaches
- `mobile-standards.md` - React Native development standards

### Feature Specifications Structure
ðŸ“‹ **Planned Spec Directories**
```
.kiro/specs/
â”œâ”€â”€ check_in_methods/
â”œâ”€â”€ virtual_queue_management/
â”œâ”€â”€ communication_notifications/
â”œâ”€â”€ remote_waiting/
â”œâ”€â”€ staff_dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ digital_signage/
â”œâ”€â”€ analytics_reporting/
â”œâ”€â”€ integration_capabilities/
â””â”€â”€ location_tracking/
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Core Feature Specifications (In Progress)
ðŸ”„ **Currently Creating**
- Feature requirements using EARS notation
- Technical design documents
- Implementation task breakdowns

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Planned)
ðŸ“… **Upcoming**
- Backend API services implementation
- Mobile app core functionality
- Staff dashboard basic features
- Initial healthcare system integrations

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Future)
ðŸ“‹ **Roadmap**
- Location-based services
- Advanced analytics
- Digital signage integration
- Performance optimization

## Development Guidelines Established

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- 80% code coverage requirement

### Security Standards
- HIPAA compliance mandatory
- End-to-end encryption for PHI
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all PHI access

### Architecture Decisions
- Microservices architecture
- React Native for cross-platform mobile
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Kafka for event streaming

### Integration Approach
- FHIR R4 compliance for healthcare data
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services

## Change Tracking

### Version 1.0 - Initial Project Setup
- **Date**: August 30, 2025
- **Changes**: Complete Kiro project initialization
- **Files Added**: 9 steering files, project structure documentation
- **Next**: Begin feature specification creation
