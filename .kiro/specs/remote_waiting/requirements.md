# Remote Waiting - Requirements

## Overview
The remote waiting system enables patients to maintain their queue position while waiting away from the healthcare facility, using location-based services and smart notifications to optimize arrival timing.

## User Stories

### Location-Based Remote Waiting

#### Enable Remote Waiting
**WHEN** a patient joins a queue **THE SYSTEM SHALL** offer them the option to wait remotely if their estimated wait time exceeds 30 minutes

**WHEN** a patient selects remote waiting **THE SYSTEM SHALL** request location permission and explain how location tracking will optimize their experience

**WHEN** a patient enables location tracking **THE SYSTEM SHALL** continuously monitor their location with their explicit consent and provide battery-optimized tracking

**WHEN** a patient's location indicates they are more than 15 minutes away from the facility **THE SYSTEM SHALL** send earlier notifications to ensure timely arrival

#### Geographic Boundaries and Zones
**WHEN** setting up remote waiting **THE SYSTEM SHALL** define geographical zones around the facility (immediate, nearby, distant) with different notification timing

**WHEN** a patient moves between zones **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically adjust notification timing and provide location-appropriate guidance

**WHEN** a patient travels beyond the maximum allowed distance (configurable, default 30 miles) **THE SYSTEM SHALL** notify them of potential issues maintaining their queue position

**WHEN** a patient requests to extend their remote waiting radius **THE SYSTEM SHALL** allow custom radius settings up to facility-defined maximum limits

### Arrival Time Optimization

#### Smart Arrival Predictions
**WHEN** calculating optimal arrival time **THE SYSTEM SHALL** consider current traffic conditions, typical travel routes, and real-time queue velocity

**WHEN** traffic conditions change significantly **THE SYSTEM SHALL** recalculate arrival recommendations and notify the patient of timing adjustments

**WHEN** a patient's usual travel route has delays **THE SYSTEM SHALL** suggest alternative routes and adjust arrival time accordingly

**WHEN** the patient has a documented travel time preference **THE SYSTEM SHALL** factor their preferred buffer time into arrival calculations

#### Dynamic Notification Timing
**WHEN** a patient is 2-3 positions away from being called **THE SYSTEM SHALL** send a "prepare to travel" notification based on their current location and travel time

**WHEN** unexpected queue delays occur **THE SYSTEM SHALL** immediately notify remote waiting patients and provide updated timing guidance

**WHEN** the queue moves faster than expected **THE SYSTEM SHALL** send urgency notifications to patients who may need to depart sooner

**WHEN** a patient doesn't respond to travel notifications **THE SYSTEM SHALL** escalate with phone calls and mark them for staff attention

### Remote Check-In Confirmation

#### Arrival Confirmation Process
**WHEN** a patient arrives at the facility **THE SYSTEM SHALL** detect their location and prompt them to confirm their arrival through the mobile app

**WHEN** a patient confirms arrival **THE SYSTEM SHALL** activate their queue position and notify staff of their presence

**WHEN** a patient arrives but doesn't confirm **THE SYSTEM SHALL** send reminder notifications every 2 minutes for up to 10 minutes

**WHEN** a patient fails to confirm arrival within 10 minutes of facility detection **THE SYSTEM SHALL** alert staff for manual verification

#### Geofencing for Automatic Detection
**WHEN** a patient enters the facility's geofenced area **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically detect their arrival and send confirmation prompts

**WHEN** geofencing accuracy is insufficient **THE SYSTEM SHALL** fall back to manual arrival confirmation with clear instructions

**WHEN** a patient's device has location services disabled **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide alternative arrival confirmation methods (QR scan, staff check-in)

### Remote Waiting Management

#### Status Monitoring and Updates
**WHEN** a patient is waiting remotely **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide real-time updates on queue position, wait time, and facility status through the mobile app

**WHEN** a patient requests current status while remote **THE SYSTEM SHALL** respond within 5 seconds with accurate position and timing information

**WHEN** facility conditions change (delays, closures, emergencies) **THE SYSTEM SHALL** immediately notify all remote waiting patients with updated information

**WHEN** a patient's queue priority changes while remote **THE SYSTEM SHALL** recalculate arrival timing and provide updated travel instructions

#### Remote Queue Position Management
**WHEN** a patient needs to temporarily leave their remote location **THE SYSTEM SHALL** allow them to update their location and adjust timing accordingly

**WHEN** a patient wants to change from remote to in-facility waiting **THE SYSTEM SHALL** seamlessly transition them without losing queue position

**WHEN** a patient on remote waiting becomes unavailable **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide options to hold their position for a specified time or reschedule

### Emergency and Exception Handling

#### Medical Emergency Protocols
**WHEN** a patient reports a medical emergency while waiting remotely **THE SYSTEM SHALL** immediately escalate to facility medical staff and provide emergency guidance

**WHEN** an emergency affects the facility **THE SYSTEM SHALL** notify all remote waiting patients and provide alternative arrangements or safety instructions

**WHEN** a patient's medical condition changes while remote **THE SYSTEM SHALL** allow them to request priority status and immediate facility access

#### Technology Failures and Backup Plans
**WHEN** a patient's mobile device fails while remote waiting **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide alternative communication methods (SMS to backup number, emergency contact notification)

**WHEN** location services fail **THE SYSTEM SHALL** switch to manual timing and confirmation while maintaining the patient's queue position

**WHEN** network connectivity is lost **THE SYSTEM SHALL** cache last known status and sync updates when connectivity is restored
