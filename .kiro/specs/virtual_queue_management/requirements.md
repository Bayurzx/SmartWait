# Virtual Queue Management - Requirements

## Overview
The virtual queue management system provides real-time tracking of patient positions, automated queue processing, and intelligent wait time estimation to optimize healthcare facility operations.

## User Stories

### Queue Creation and Management

#### Queue Initialization
**WHEN** a healthcare facility starts operations for the day **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically create queues for each available appointment type and service area

**WHEN** a new queue is created **THE SYSTEM SHALL** set the maximum capacity based on facility configuration and available resources

**WHEN** a queue reaches 80% capacity **THE SYSTEM SHALL** notify facility administrators and offer options to increase capacity or redirect patients

**WHEN** a facility needs to temporarily close a queue **THE SYSTEM SHALL** prevent new patients from joining while maintaining existing queue positions

#### Queue Configuration
**WHEN** an administrator configures queue parameters **THE SYSTEM SHALL** allow setting maximum capacity, average processing time, and priority rules

**WHEN** queue parameters are updated **THE SYSTEM SHALL** recalculate all estimated wait times within 30 seconds

**WHEN** multiple queues exist for the same facility **THE SYSTEM SHALL** enable patient routing based on urgency, appointment type, and resource availability

### Patient Queue Operations

#### Joining Queues
**WHEN** a patient completes check-in **THE SYSTEM SHALL** add them to the appropriate queue based on appointment type and assign a unique position

**WHEN** a patient is added to a queue **THE SYSTEM SHALL** calculate their estimated wait time using historical data and current queue status

**WHEN** a queue is at maximum capacity **THE SYSTEM SHALL** offer the patient options to join a waitlist or schedule for a later time

**WHEN** a patient has special needs or accessibility requirements **THE SYSTEM SHALL** prioritize their position appropriately while maintaining fairness

#### Queue Position Updates
**WHEN** a patient ahead in queue is served **THE SYSTEM SHALL** advance all subsequent patients' positions and update estimated wait times within 10 seconds

**WHEN** a patient leaves the queue voluntarily **THE SYSTEM SHALL** remove them from the queue and adjust all subsequent positions immediately

**WHEN** a patient is marked as "no-show" **THE SYSTEM SHALL** remove them from the queue after a configurable grace period (default 15 minutes)

**WHEN** a patient's priority changes due to medical urgency **THE SYSTEM SHALL** adjust their position accordingly and notify affected patients of updated wait times

#### Real-Time Position Tracking
**WHEN** a patient requests their current position **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide real-time position, updated estimated wait time, and facility status

**WHEN** a patient's estimated wait time changes by more than 10 minutes **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically send them an updated notification

**WHEN** a patient is within 2 positions of being called **THE SYSTEM SHALL** send an "almost ready" notification and request confirmation of their availability

**WHEN** a patient doesn't respond to the "almost ready" notification within 5 minutes **THE SYSTEM SHALL** send a follow-up notification and mark them as potentially unavailable

### Staff Queue Management

#### Queue Monitoring
**WHEN** staff access the queue management dashboard **THE SYSTEM SHALL** display real-time queue status, patient information, and estimated processing times for all active queues

**WHEN** a queue experiences unusual delays **THE SYSTEM SHALL** alert staff and provide recommendations for queue optimization

**WHEN** multiple staff members are managing the same queue **THE SYSTEM SHALL** prevent conflicts through optimistic locking and real-time synchronization

#### Patient Processing
**WHEN** staff select "call next patient" **THE SYSTEM SHALL** identify the next patient in priority order and send them a notification to proceed

**WHEN** a patient is called but doesn't respond **THE SYSTEM SHALL** allow staff to mark them as "no-show" or "delayed" and automatically call the next patient

**WHEN** staff need to call a specific patient out of order **THE SYSTEM SHALL** allow manual selection while maintaining audit trails and adjusting subsequent positions

**WHEN** a patient consultation is completed **THE SYSTEM SHALL** remove them from the queue and trigger position updates for remaining patients

#### Queue Adjustments
**WHEN** staff need to pause a queue temporarily **THE SYSTEM SHALL** stop new position assignments while preserving existing queue order

**WHEN** staff need to merge queues due to resource changes **THE SYSTEM SHALL** combine patient lists fairly while maintaining approximate wait times

**WHEN** an emergency situation requires queue prioritization **THE SYSTEM SHALL** allow staff to implement emergency protocols and notify all affected patients

### Wait Time Estimation

#### Dynamic Time Calculation
**WHEN** calculating estimated wait times **THE SYSTEM SHALL** consider current queue position, historical processing times, staff availability, and time of day patterns

**WHEN** historical data is insufficient **THE SYSTEM SHALL** use configured default processing times and adjust based on real-time observations

**WHEN** wait time estimates become inaccurate **THE SYSTEM SHALL** automatically recalibrate using machine learning algorithms and recent processing data

#### Factors Affecting Wait Times
**WHEN** appointment complexity varies **THE SYSTEM SHALL** adjust processing time estimates based on appointment type and patient history

**WHEN** staff availability changes **THE SYSTEM SHALL** recalculate wait times based on the number of active providers and their processing speeds

**WHEN** facility resources (rooms, equipment) become limited **THE SYSTEM SHALL** factor resource availability into wait time calculations

### Queue Analytics and Reporting

#### Real-Time Metrics
**WHEN** administrators request queue performance data **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide real-time metrics including average wait time, queue throughput, and patient satisfaction indicators

**WHEN** patterns indicate potential issues **THE SYSTEM SHALL** proactively alert administrators with specific recommendations for optimization

**WHEN** comparing queue performance across time periods **THE SYSTEM SHALL** provide trend analysis and identify factors contributing to efficiency changes

#### Historical Analysis
**WHEN** generating historical reports **THE SYSTEM SHALL** analyze queue performance trends, peak usage patterns, and optimization opportunities

**WHEN** unusual queue patterns are detected **THE SYSTEM SHALL** flag them for administrator review and provide potential explanations

**WHEN** preparing compliance reports **THE SYSTEM SHALL** include wait time distributions, patient flow metrics, and service level adherence data
