  beforeEach(() => {
    mockRepository = createMockQueueRepository();

  describe('addPatientToQueue', () => {
    it('should add patient to queue with correct position', async () => {
      const queueData = createMockQueue({ currentSize: 5 });
      const patientData = createMockPatient();
      
      mockRepository.findById.mockResolvedValue(queueData);
      mockRepository.getNextPosition.mockResolvedValue(6);

      const result = await engine.addPatientToQueue({
        queueId: queueData.id,
        patientId: patientData.id,
        priority: 5
      });

      expect(result.position).toBe(6);
      expect(mockRepository.save).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        expect.objectContaining({ position: 6 })
      );
    });

    it('should handle queue capacity limits', async () => {
      const fullQueue = createMockQueue({ 
        currentSize: 50, 
        capacity: { maximum: 50 } 
      });
      
      mockRepository.findById.mockResolvedValue(fullQueue);
