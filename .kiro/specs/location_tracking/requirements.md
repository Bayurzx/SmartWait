---

## Story 5: Location-Based Wait Time Estimation

### User Story
As a patient, I want accurate wait time estimates based on my current location so that I can plan my time effectively while waiting for my appointment.

### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

**WHEN** a patient's location changes relative to the facility THE SYSTEM SHALL adjust wait time estimates based on travel time to appointment

**WHEN** a patient is remote from the facility THE SYSTEM SHALL include travel time in wait time calculations and provide departure recommendations

**WHEN** traffic conditions or transportation delays occur THE SYSTEM SHALL update arrival time estimates and adjust queue notifications

**WHEN** a patient is already at the facility THE SYSTEM SHALL provide more precise wait time estimates based on provider availability and queue movement

**WHEN** location-based wait time estimates are calculated THE SYSTEM SHALL consider historical traffic patterns and appointment complexity

**WHEN** wait time estimates change significantly THE SYSTEM SHALL notify patients with updated timing and reasoning

**WHEN** location services are unavailable THE SYSTEM SHALL fallback to standard wait time estimates without location factors

## Story 6: Provider and Staff Location Services

### User Story
As healthcare staff, I want location-aware assignment and routing so that I can be efficiently directed to patients and optimize my workflow.

### Acceptance Criteria (EARS Notation)

**WHEN** a provider needs to see a patient THE SYSTEM SHALL provide optimal routing within the facility considering current provider location
