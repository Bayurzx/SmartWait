### 5. Error Scenarios Tests (`error-scenarios.test.ts`)

**Purpose:** Tests system behavior under various error conditions

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Invalid data types, missing fields, malformed requests
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Duplicate check-ins with same phone number
- ✅ **Resource Not Found**: Non-existent patient lookups
- ✅ **Authentication Errors**: Invalid tokens, missing headers, expired sessions
- ✅ **Concurrent Conflicts**: Race conditions and concurrent operation safety
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: System behavior under high load

**Key Validations:**
- Consistent error response formats
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful error handling
- System stability under stress

### 6. Bug Fixes Tests (`bug-fixes.test.ts`)

**Purpose:** Tests for specific bugs found and fixed during integration testing

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ **Position Calculation**: Correct position assignment after patient completion
- ✅ **Concurrent Operations**: Race condition handling in position assignment
- ✅ **Authentication Edge Cases**: Token validation and error handling
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Special characters, international phone numbers
- ✅ **Queue State Consistency**: Integrity after multiple operations
- ✅ **Performance**: Large queue handling without degradation

## Test Execution

### Running All Integration Tests

```bash
# Run complete integration test suite
npm run test:integration

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=complete-patient-journey.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Runner Features

The integration test suite includes a comprehensive test runner (`test-runner.ts`) that provides:

- **Critical Path Testing**: Quick validation of core functionality
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed test results and statistics
- **Environment Setup**: Automatic test environment preparation and cleanup
- **Error Reporting**: Clear failure messages and debugging information

### Test Environment Setup

Before running tests, ensure:

1. **Database**: PostgreSQL running with test database
2. **Redis**: Redis server running for real-time features
3. **Environment Variables**: Proper test configuration
4. **Dependencies**: All npm packages installed

```bash
# Setup test environment
npm run setup:test

# Verify test environment
npm run test:health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Issues

1. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
2. **Redis Connection**: Verify Redis server is available
3. **Port Conflicts**: Check that required ports (3001, 6379) are available
4. **Environment Variables**: Validate all required env vars are set
5. **Network Issues**: Ensure WebSocket connections can be established

### Debug Mode

Run tests with debug information:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=smartwait:* npm run test:integration

# Run single test with verbose output
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=complete-patient-journey.test.ts --verbose
```

### Test Data Cleanup

Tests automatically clean up test data, but manual cleanup can be performed:

```bash
# Clean test database
npm run test:cleanup

# Reset test environment
npm run test:reset
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Integration Tests

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
2. **Cleanup**: Always clean up test data in beforeEach/afterEach hooks
3. **Assertions**: Use specific assertions that validate expected behavior
4. **Error Testing**: Test both success and failure scenarios
5. **Performance**: Include timing assertions for critical operations

### Test Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep tests updated with code changes
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor test execution times
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Regularly review test coverage reports
4. **Bug Regression**: Add tests for every bug fix
5. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation current
