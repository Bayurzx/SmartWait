## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Login process
1. User enters credentials
2. API validates against staff database
3. JWT token generated and stored in localStorage
4. User redirected to dashboard
5. Token validated on each API request
6. Automatic logout on token expiration
```

### Real-Time Updates
```typescript
// WebSocket integration
1. Dashboard connects to WebSocket server
2. Joins 'staff' room for queue updates
3. Receives real-time notifications when:
   - Patients check in
   - Patients are called
   - Patients are completed
   - Queue positions change
4. Automatically refreshes queue data
```

### Queue Operations
```typescript
// Call Next Patient
1. Identifies next waiting patient
2. Updates patient status to 'called'
3. Sends SMS notification to patient
4. Broadcasts update to all connected clients
5. Refreshes dashboard queue display

// Complete Patient
1. Updates patient status to 'completed'
2. Advances remaining patients' positions
3. Broadcasts queue updates
4. Removes patient from active queue
```

## API Integration

### Staff Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/staff/login` - Staff login with credentials
- `GET /api/staff/profile` - Get current staff profile
- `POST /api/staff/logout` - Staff logout

### Queue Management Endpoints

- `POST /api/staff/call-next` - Call next patient in queue
- `POST /api/staff/complete` - Mark patient as completed

### WebSocket Events
- `queue_update` - Real-time queue changes
- `patient_called` - Patient status change to called
- `patient_completed` - Patient completion notification

## Usage Guide
